## **Kages Code Portfollio**

### Current Projects

**Simple 3D Engine**
  This started as a cmake project to get comfortable with adding libraries like SFML and working with source control. I had an idea for a simple game but i liked the idea of having some really simple 3D aspects. I decided rather than coding one simple 3d object i might as well make a lightweight engine that is more versitile that i could use in future projects. I will create a new repo for the game i was thinking of and this repo will be dedicated to making a barebones 3d engine.
